                    <p>Eli has loved anything and everything involving a ball ever since he was little. From playing tennis with his parents at Denver Tennis Park and Crestmoor, to the baseball diamond & basketball court at Kent Denver, Eli is always happiest when in motion. Win or lose (and he's had his fair share of both) Eli loves the thrill of competition.</p>
                    <p>As he celebrates this important milestone in his Jewish journey, Eli is excited to share his love for sports and how he has explored his Judaism through sports and other Jewish wisdom projects. Eli will share more about this journey with you as he celebrates becoming a Be Mitzvah at Coors Field on August 23, 2025.</p>

                    <p>Judaism Your Way is an inclusive, pluralistic Jewish community that welcomes and celebrates Jews from all backgrounds and traditions. Their innovative approach to Be Mitzvah celebrations honors both tradition and personal meaning.</p>
                    <p>A Be Mitzvah is a gender-neutral term for this Jewish coming-of-age ceremony, creating space for all youth to celebrate this milestone in ways that feel authentic to their identity and connection to Judaism.</p>
                    <p>Through Judaism Your Way's program, young people engage in meaningful Jewish learning, community service, and personal reflection as they prepare to be called to the Torah as a Be Mitzvah.</p>

                <p>With Judaism Your Way the students get to choose how they want to explore Judaism.  The way I chose to pursue this journey was  by doing 9 Jewish wisdom projects to resemble the 9 innings of a baseball game. All of the wisdom projects were my choice.  This was an incredible gift.  I am so grateful that Judaism Your Way (and my parents) gave me this independence and freedom and I am excited to share more about this journey with my friend and family in August!   .</p>

                <p>As a little preview I will share that most of my wisdom projects fell into these categories</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jewish Figures who made an impact of their profession</li>
                    <li> Making traditional Jewish recipes</li>
                    <li>Tikkun Olam service projects for the community </li>
                    <li>Playing tennis as part of the Maccabi games, also known as the Jewish Olympics</li>
