                    <p>Eli has loved anything and everything involving a ball ever since he stepped foot on a field or a court for the first time. From playing tennis with his parents at Denver Tennis Park and Crestmoor, to the baseball diamond & basketball court at Kent Denver, Eli is always happiest when in motion. Win or lose (and he's had his fair share of both) Eli loves the thrill of competition.</p>
                    <p>As he celebrates this important milestone in his Jewish journey, Eli is excited to share his love for sports and how he has explored his Judaism through sports and other Jewish wisdom projects. Eli will share more about this journey with you as he celebrates becoming a Be Mitzvah at Coors Field on August 23, 2025.</p>

                    <p>Judaism Your Way is an inclusive, pluralistic Jewish community that welcomes and celebrates Jews from all backgrounds and traditions. Their innovative approach to Be Mitzvah celebrations honors both tradition and personal meaning.</p>
                    <p>A Be Mitzvah is a gender-neutral term for this Jewish coming-of-age ceremony, creating space for all youth to celebrate this milestone in ways that feel authentic to their identity and connection to Judaism.</p>
                    <p>Through Judaism Your Way's program, young people engage in meaningful Jewish learning, community service, and personal reflection as they prepare to be called to the Torah as a Be Mitzvah.</p>

            <div class="journey-content">
                <p>With Judaism Your Way there is always a different option. As said in the name, everything you do is your way. The way I chose was doing 9 Jewish wisdom projects to resemble the 9 innings of a baseball game. All of the wisdom projects were at my discretion, what I wanted to do. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to do what I pick, and not be made do something. This was an incredible gift, the ability to do things I'm interested in. Not what others want me to do and be interested in, but what pleases me. This is very important to me because it makes me feel like I have more say and independence with what I do which allows me to be more invested in it because it's something I actually enjoy doing and want to do.</p>

                <p>Some if the wisdom projects I did fell into these categories</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jewish Figures who made an impact of their profession</li>
                    <li>New Food Making and making both traditional Jewish recipes and grilling with my dad</li>
                    <li>Tikkun Olam service projects for the community that gives back to those less fortunate than us</li>
                    <li>Sports figures who are Jewish and playing tennis as part of the Mccabi games, the Jewish Olympics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I chose these projects from these categories because all of the projects I did were important to me. From sorts, to giving back to the community, to expanding my comfort zone and cooking, all of these things I wanted to do and try.</p>
