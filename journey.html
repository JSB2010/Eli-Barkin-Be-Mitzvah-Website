                    <p>Eli has loved anything and everything involving a ball ever since he stepped foot on a field or a court for the first time. From playing tennis with his parents at Denver Tennis Park and Crestmoor, to the baseball diamond & basketball court at Kent Denver, Eli is always happiest when in motion. Win or lose (and he's had his fair share of both) Eli loves the thrill of competition.</p>
                    <p>As he celebrates this important milestone in his Jewish journey, Eli is excited to share his love for sports and how he has explored his Judaism through sports and other Jewish wisdom projects. Eli will share more about this journey with you as he celebrates becoming a Be Mitzvah at Coors Field on August 23, 2025.</p>
