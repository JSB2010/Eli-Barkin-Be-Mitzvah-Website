### DNS Configuration
- [ ] Add SPF record to domain DNS
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Host: @
  Value: v=spf1 include:spf.sendinblue.com include:_spf.google.com ~all
  ```

- [ ] Add DKIM record to domain DNS (after generating in Brevo)
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Host: <selector>._domainkey
  Value: <provided by Brevo>
  ```

- [ ] Add DMARC record to domain DNS
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Host: _dmarc
  Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:jacobsamuelbarkin@gmail.com; adkim=r; aspf=r; pct=100;
  ```

### Brevo Configuration
- [ ] Verify domain ownership in Brevo
- [ ] Generate and implement DKIM keys in Brevo
- [ ] Configure bounce handling in Brevo
- [ ] Set up suppression list management
- [ ] Configure sender name consistency

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify DNS records have propagated (wait 24-48 hours)
- [ ] Run enhanced email deliverability test
- [ ] Test sending to Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple Mail
- [ ] Check inboxing vs. spam folder placement
- [ ] Monitor deliverability metrics in Brevo

## Final Verification Steps

After implementing all DNS records and Brevo configurations:

1. Run the enhanced test tool:
   ```bash
   node enhanced-email-deliverability-test.js
   ```

2. Conduct an actual delivery test:
   ```bash
   node test-email-delivery.js
   ```

3. Monitor test emails for at least a week to ensure consistent delivery.

4. Check Brevo analytics for delivery metrics and spam complaints.

5. Make any required adjustments based on test results.

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **DNS Propagation Delays**: Records can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate. Be patient when testing.
- **DKIM Key Mismatches**: Ensure the exact DKIM record provided by Brevo is added without alterations.
- **Incomplete SPF Record**: Make sure your SPF includes all services that send email on your behalf.
- **Missing HTML Best Practices**: Already fixed in your templates but continue to follow best practices.

## Ongoing Maintenance

- Monthly: Run the email deliverability test to verify configuration.
- After DNS Changes: Re-verify email authentication is working.
- After Brevo Account Changes: Check sender configuration.
- Monitor: Keep an eye on deliverability metrics in Brevo.
